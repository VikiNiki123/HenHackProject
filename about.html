        <h3>Hey!</h3>
           <div class="container1">
                <p>&emsp; My name is <em>Victoria Nikolaeva</em>. I am currently a student at Univeristy of Delaware, studying for a
                    Computer Science BA with a minor of Interactive Media Design. I have a passion for art & design, which has influenced me into going into
                    wanting to be part of UX/UI design feild as my goal for after graduating from UD. Besides that, I am a 2-year old adult that is on her 
                    last year of being a teen so I got to make it count for before I hit 20. Recently, I got an intership with Digital Delmarva for a web-devlopement
                    and graphic design program. The fun part is that currently, this may or may not be presented to the judges at HenHacks so if y'all see this...hi :)

                    <br><br><strong>&emsp; Thank You for stopping by!</strong>

        <h3>Why Create this Site?</h3>
            <p>
                This website is all about teaching kids about Media Literacy. As explained before, media literacy is the ability to critically analyze stories
                present in mass media and being able to determine the creditability and truthfulness of a source. It helps as both user's and 
                consumers to stay informed with the world around us. However, with the Internet, anybody can be a journalist and create articles and state them as
                facts. This becomes, especially, problematic, when people already assume that people has this skill. Keyword: skill. I find this troublesome for young
                children. According to recent research, children ages 2 to 8 spend an average of two hours per day, children between 8 and 12 spend four to six hours, and 
                adolescents over 12 years old spend an average of seven to nine hours per day. These kids are growing up with advance technoogy, so people assume that they 
                know how to do alot of things involving it but yet that is not the case. Remember, kids are still native and impressionable, exposing them to the wild west
                 without a good backbone of how to be safe and informed will  always end in misguided indualivals that could continue a line of misinformation. 
                 But yet, I dont think that only parents and schools should push for this type of education, children need to be able to participate in this form of learning too,
                  whats why this exists; to help children have fun while learning about media literacy.
