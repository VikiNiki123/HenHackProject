        <h2>Relevancy</h2>
        <caption><em>The Importance of the Information You Need</em></caption>
        <p>
            Relevance is paramount in media literacy as it enhances individuals' ability to engage critically with the information they encounter. 
            Understanding the relevance of media content to one's life, interests, or societal context enables individuals to assess its significance 
            and impact more effectively. By identifying relevant media, individuals can prioritize their attention, delve deeper into topics of personal 
            or societal importance, and make informed decisions about the information they consume. Moreover, relevance fosters active engagement with media, 
            motivating individuals to seek out diverse perspectives and critically evaluate the content's credibility and bias. In essence, relevance serves 
            as a guiding principle in media literacy, empowering individuals to navigate the complex media landscape with discernment, purpose, and meaningful 
            participation.
