            <h3 class="subheader">What is Media Literacy?</h3>
                <div class="container1">
                    <p>Media literacy is the ability to critically analyze, evaluate, and interpret media messages in all their forms, 
                        including print, digital, and visual media. It involves understanding how media are created, the techniques used to 
                        convey messages, and the potential impact they have on individuals and society. Media literacy empowers individuals 
                        to navigate the complex media landscape, discerning between fact and fiction, recognizing bias and propaganda, and 
                        making informed choices about the media they consume and create. By developing media literacy skills, individuals 
                        can better understand the role of media in shaping attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors, and actively engage as informed 
                        citizens in today's digital world.

            <h3 class="subheader">Why Need Media Literacy?</h3>
                <p>Students require media literacy to effectively navigate the inundation of information pervasive in today's digital landscape.
                    Media literacy is indispensable as it cultivates critical thinking skills, enabling students to discern between credible sources
                    and misinformation rampant in online platforms. Additionally, it equips them with essential research abilities, facilitating the 
                    evaluation of sources' reliability and the synthesis of diverse viewpoints. Beyond academia, media literacy promotes responsible digital 
                    citizenship, educating students on ethical engagement, online safety, and digital rights. Moreover, it empowers students to actively 
                    participate in media creation, fostering a deeper understanding of media construction and its societal impact. Through media literacy, 
                    students develop cultural awareness, embracing diverse perspectives and fostering empathy in an interconnected world. Ultimately, 
                    media literacy is paramount for students to thrive in a digitally driven society, empowering them to think critically, engage responsibly, 
                    and contribute meaningfully to public discourse.
